# Linux for Devops #
Here I am gonna give the information that are really need to solve Real world problems. Instead i can give the information from the very beginning of the Linux like how it was first started, who developed and all this stuff is not really important in present beacause all the information is right available on our hands. So, I believe `one can assesed based on how quicly can we learn rather than how much we know`. No more boring suff Let's start!
